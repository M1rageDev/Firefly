# Firefly - Revamped aerodyanmic effects for KSP

## Credits

The mod's icon and particle sprites were created by thunderchild, who has also made incredible concept arts for the mod and helped shape it the way it is now. The effects would definitely not look as good as they do now without him.

Massive thanks to @JonnyOThan for making some really awesome optimizations to the mod's plugin and other support.

The core shader was based on Leah Lindner's paper describing a method of creating promising reentry VFX, which can be found here: https://leah-lindner.com/blog/atmospheric-entry/
Without the paper, this mod would definitely not be possible.

Massive thanks to all the people mentioned here, as well as everyone from the early testing groups, without which the mod would probably be much different than it is now.
