# Firefly

A mod for Kerbal Space Program, made to revamp reentry and aerodynamic effects.

## Features
Firefly completely replaces the stock aerodynamic VFX with it's own system.
- Has built-in compatibility for popular planet packs: RSS and KSRSS
- Gives planet pack creators the option to create custom configs for planets and moons, which describe how the effects look
- Allows custom "envelopes" for parts
- Has a set of template configs for planet packs, planets and parts

For instructions on writing configs and making envelopes, as well as other info check the [wiki]().

## Dependencies
The only **required** dependency is:
- [ModuleManager](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)

## Installation
We recommend installing the mod with CKAN, but if you want to do it manually, then place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder (allow to merge, if asked).

## Credits
The mod's icon and particle sprites were created by thunderchild, who has also made incredible concept arts for the mod and helped shape it the way it is now. The effects would definitely not look as good as they do now without him.

Massive thanks to JonnyOThan for making some really awesome optimizations to the mod's plugin and other support.

The core shader was based on Leah Lindner's [paper](https://leah-lindner.com/blog/atmospheric-entry/) describing a method of creating promising reentry VFX.
Without the paper, this mod would definitely not be possible.

Massive thanks to all the people mentioned here, as well as everyone from the early testing groups, without which the mod would probably be much different than it is now, or wouldn't exist at all :)
