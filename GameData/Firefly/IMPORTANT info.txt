Mod made by MirageDev, thunderchild, Knedlik and JonnyOThan

IMPORTANT: Please read the bundled LICENSE agreement text file before testing. I tried to keep it as short and simple as possible.

This is a testing version of the mod, so expect bugs and weird stuff to happen.
Please turn the stock aerodynamic effects slider to the lowest value, otherwise the effects will mix with the stock ones.

Important note: I have not tested this with OpenGL/Mac/Linux, so please report if anything weird happens on it.

Instructions on how to make custom envelopes for parts is in a separate text file next to this one. If you make one then please send it to me, of course I'll give credit for it on release.
Instructions on creating custom atmosphere configs as well as planet pack configs are also in a separate text files. Same as the custom envelopes, sending your work to me would be much appreciated.
Instructions on creating custom part color override configs are in a separate text file. There are some provided templates in the Templates folder.

You can see debug info and override settings on/off in the toolbar app window (app has an icon of a capsule reentry).

Parts which use Skinned Mesh Renderers, like Kerbals or inflatable centrifuges might have issues. Please report any parts which don't work.

As always, when reporting anything post your KSP.log and a screenshot of both of the mod's windows if possible.
