Creating custom planet pack configs:

Here's a template config (taken from RSS):
ATMOFX_PLANET_PACK:NEEDS[RealSolarSystem]
{
	name = RSS_Configs
	
	speed_multiplier = 1
	
	affected_bodies = Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan, Uranus, Neptune
}


Planet pack configs are used to have a global speed multiplier for entire packs, to make atmosphere configs easier to create.

--- Value explanations:
name - The name of the planet pack config, needs to be unique
speed_multiplier - Overall airspeed multiplier for the entire planet pack
affected_bodies - Specifies which celestial bodies are affected by the config. Make sure to separate the items with a comma (,)
