Creating custom part color override configs:

Here's a template config, which changes the streak color of the trail to green:
ATMOFX_PART
{
	name = bluedog_Apollo_Heatshield
	
	Color
	{
		glow = null
		
		trail_streak = 91 191 74 3
		wrap_streak = 91 191 74 3
	}
}


Part color override configs are used to override certain or all colors of the plasma effects for individual parts.

--- Value explanations:
name - The name of the part which this configs is applied to

--- Color:
The actual color overrides, same as the ones from planet configs.
When you don't want to override a certain color property, you can not write it at all OR write "null" / "default" instead of the actual color, as shown in the template config above
