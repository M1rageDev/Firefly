Creating custom atmosphere configs:

Here's a template config (taken from Duna):
ATMOFX_BODY
{
	name = Duna
	strength_multiplier = 1
	
	length_multiplier = 1
	opacity_multiplier = 1
	wrap_fresnel_modifier = 0
	
	particle_threshold = 1200
	
	streak_probability = 0.07
	streak_threshold = -0.2
	
	Color
	{
		glow = 191 80 50 1.4
		glow_hot = 191 90 65 2.5
		
		trail_primary = 76 116 191 2.5
		trail_secondary = 151 130 191 1.8
		trail_tertiary = 191 124 73 2
		trail_streak = 191 124 73 2
		
		wrap_layer = 191 124 73 2
		wrap_streak = 76 116 191 2.5
		
		shockwave = 34 41 191 3
	}
}


--- Value explanations:
name - The bodyName of the celestial body this config will be applied to
strength_multiplier - The entry speed gets multiplied by this before getting sent to the shader
length_multiplier - The trail length gets multiplied by this
opacity_muliplier - The trail's opacity is multiplied by this value
wrap_fresnel_modifier - Modifier for the wrap layer's fresnel effect, bigger values make the wrap layer more opaque in front of the spacecraft
particle_threshold - The airspeed threshold in m/s for particles to appear
streak_probability - This gets added to the streak probability of the shader. Should be very low, look in the stock configs for reference, located in Configs/Stock
streak_threshold - This gets added to the streak speed threshold of the shader, which is 0.5 by default (overall range is 0-1, where 1 is 4000 m/s and 0 is 0 m/s)

--- Color explanations:
Each color is composed of 4 values, RGB and HDR intensity. The final color is the result of RGB*(2^intensity)
glow - The color of the glow of surfaces exposed to the airstream
glow_hot - Alternate glow color. This color is a bit more visible at higher speeds.
trail_primary - The primary color of the trail, used for the start of the trail
trail_secondary - The secondary color of the trail, used for most of the trail of the trail and randomly for the start
trail_tertiary - The tertiary color of the trail, used for the ending of the trail
trail_streak - The streak color of the trail
wrap_layer - Main color of the wrap layer
wrap_streak - Streak color of the wrap layer
shockwave - The color of the bowshock
